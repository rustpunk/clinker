//!
//! - **E358** — a malformed declaration on a source: two `split_to_rows`
//!   entries naming the same or nested field groups, a duplicate
//!   `split_values` field, or a `split_values` field the schema does not
//!   declare `multiple: true`.
//! - **E359** — a `multiple: true` column reaching an output whose format has
//!   no multi-value encoding, which would degrade or reject the value at the
//!   sink instead of at compile.
//! - **E361** — a `multiple: true` column on a source whose format has no way
//!   to PRODUCE one, which would bind the column as an array and then hand
//!   CXL a scalar.
//!
//! E359 and E361 are the two arrows of the same rule, and each reads its own
